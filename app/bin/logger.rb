# ABSTRACT
# This utility daemon is responsible for reporting various system-level
# activities to the appropriate log files. It attempts to catch all
# messages thrown by the various daemons, and then writes the message
# to the log file for possible transmission back to mission control. It
# is responsible for rolling the log files, and recycling logging space
# if the log directory starts to fill up - hopefully that won't happen.
